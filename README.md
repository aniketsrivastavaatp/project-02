# project-02
In this project, we'll build a simple python script.
This script has two functionalities:
1) It checks if a given number is prime or not in an efficient way?
2) It prints out the list of prime numbers and prints how many prime numbers are there within the range in a very efficient way.

To use the first functionalities of this script you need to enter 1 when prompted and then the number(which you want to check whether it is prime or not).
To use the second functionalities of this script you need to enter 2 when prompted and then the number.
